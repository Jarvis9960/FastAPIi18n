# FastAPI Internationalization Demo

## Overview

This is a FastAPI application that demonstrates internationalization (i18n) capabilities. The application provides a foundation for building multilingual web services with support for English, Spanish, and French languages. The system uses GNU gettext for translation management and includes middleware for handling language preferences.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework
- **FastAPI**: Chosen as the primary web framework for its modern async capabilities, automatic API documentation, and excellent type hint support
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Utilizes FastAPI's async capabilities for better performance and scalability

### Internationalization Architecture
- **GNU Gettext**: Selected for translation management due to its industry-standard status and robust tooling ecosystem
- **Translation Loading Strategy**: Translations are loaded once at application startup and stored in memory for fast access
- **Language Support**: Currently supports English (default), Spanish, and French with extensible architecture for additional languages
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Implements graceful degradation to default language when translations are missing

### Application Lifecycle Management
- **Lifespan Context Manager**: Uses FastAPI's lifespan events to handle application startup and shutdown
- **Directory Management**: Automatically creates the locales directory structure if it doesn't exist
- **Translation Preloading**: All translations are loaded into memory during application startup to avoid file I/O during request handling

### Request Processing
- **Middleware Architecture**: Prepared for middleware-based language detection and request processing
- **Type Safety**: Utilizes Pydantic models and Python type hints for robust data validation and API documentation

### File Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Translation files are organized in a standard locales directory structure
- **Configuration Management**: Language settings and supported locales are centrally configured

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **FastAPI**: Primary web framework for building the API
- **Starlette**: ASGI framework that powers FastAPI's middleware capabilities
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization library integrated with FastAPI

### Internationalization Dependencies
- **gettext**: Python's built-in internationalization library for translation management
- **pathlib**: Modern path handling for file system operations

### System Dependencies
- **GNU Gettext Tools**: Required for generating and managing translation files (.po, .mo files)
- **File System**: Requires read/write access for locales directory management

### Development Dependencies
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `re`, `typing` for core functionality
- No external database dependencies in current implementation
- No external API integrations in current implementation
